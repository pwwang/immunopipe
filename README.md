<hr />

`immunopipe` is a pipeline based on [`pipen`](https://github.com/pwwang/pipen) framework. It includes a set of processes for scTCR- and scRNA-seq data analysis in `R`, `python` and `bash`. The pipeline is designed to be flexible and configurable.

## Gallery

There are some datasets with both scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq data available in the publications. The data were reanalyzed using `immunopipe` with the configurations provided in each repository, where the results are also available.

Check out the [gallery](https://pwwang.github.io/immunopipe/gallery) for more details.
